How boot code works?
===

1. After compiled, boot.S is place at boot sector of floppy disk which is read and loaded into memory at 0x7c00 by BIOS code

2. boot.S is in charged of loading boot0.S into a certain place in memory and execute it 

3. At this phase, boot0.S is just a simple program that prints out a message. We can replace it by a kernel in next phase.
