How boot code works?
===

1. After compiled, boot1.S is placed at boot sector of floppy disk which is read and loaded into memory at 0x7c00 by BIOS code

2. boot1.S is in charged of loading boot2.S into a certain place in memory and execute it 

3. At this phase, boot2.S is just a simple program that prints out a message. We can make it to load a kernel in the future.
