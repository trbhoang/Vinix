How boot code works?
===

1. After compiled, boot1.S is placed at boot sector of floppy disk which is read and loaded into memory at 0x7c00 by BIOS code.
   Boot1 contains 16-bit code which does the following:
   - load stage2 to 0x500
   - load descriptor tables (IDT, GDT)
   - enable A20
   - load kernel image to 0x10000
   - goto Protected Mode
   - jump to stage2

2. boot2 contains 32-bit code:
   - jump to kernel 



Notes
===

= Global Descriptor Table

  The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) defines the global memory map. It defines what memory can be executed (Code Descriptor),
  and what area contains data (Data Descriptor).

  For GDT, a "descriptor" is a 8-byte value that describes certain properties for its segment
