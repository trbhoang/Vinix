1. Learn how to create a floppy image file formatted as FAT12 (or whatever file system) on Linux
   - the boot loader & kernel will all stay on this floppy image

   ===
   - tools:
     + mkdosfs
     + dd: Linux command for copy and convert a file 
     
   - ref:
     + man mkdosfs
     + http://wiki.osdev.org/Loopback_Device
     + http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/grub.html (how to copy stage1 & stage2 boot loader to floppy.img)

   ===
   - create the floppy.img file using dd:
     $ dd if=/dev/zero of=floppy.img bs=512 count=2880
   - format floppy.img as FAT12
     $ sudo mkdosfs -F12 floppy.img

2. Copy 2-stage bootloader to correct places on floppy.img
     $ dd if=stage1 of=floppy.img count=1
     $ dd if=stage2 of=floppy.img seek=1
   
3. Build a 2-stage bootloader
   - stage 1 binary is recorded on boot sector (first 512 bytes) of floppy image
   - stage 2 binary is recorded as a file on floppy image and is loaded into memory by stage 1
   - kernel will then be loaded by stage 2
   
4. Write the kernel
